<h3>It is a game where " The Guesser ", will select a number from 1 to 100, player(s) are required to guess the same number.</h3>
<h3>WhoSoEver guess' the number first will win this game.</h3>
<h3>Really !!</h3>
<h3>Looks very simple, right !!</h3>
<h3>Here is the catch</h3>
<h3>If multiple players are turning up for this game, then the number of SET(s) will be equal to the total number of players.</h3>
<h3>For eg, if 3 players enroll for this game, they will have to play 3 SETs of game.</h3>
<h3>Based on the performance in each SET, THE UMPIRE will decide the winner.</h3>
